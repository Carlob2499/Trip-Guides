# Pipeline V2 — Implementation State (durable resume record)

> Maintained by the implementation agent per `FABLE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`. A resumed session
> reads THIS file, inspects `git log` on `codex/pipeline-v2` and the working diff, and continues
> from "Next action" below. Never regenerate completed work.

## Position

- **Last completed milestone:** M1 — Repair current publication safety
- **Current milestone:** M2 — Versioned V2 contracts
- **Exact next action:** Design and implement `scripts/pipeline/v2/` runtime-validated contracts
  (run state, evidence/candidates, coverage, reconciliation dispositions, telemetry) + fail-closed
  validation + V1 readers + contract tests (valid/missing/malformed/legacy/forward-compatible).

## Branch

- Feature branch: `codex/pipeline-v2`, forked from `main` @ `9f1599b` (docs: add Pipeline V2
  Fable execution prompt). Working tree was clean at fork; no user changes at risk.
- Latest pushed commit: (M0 commit — see `git log`)

## Baseline (recorded 2026-08-17, M0)

All four gates green on `main` @ 9f1599b before any V2 work:

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Full test suite | `npm test` | 155 files, 2400 passed, 1 todo — exit 0 |
| Build | `npm run build` | 9 pages, schema clean — exit 0 |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | 0 errors, 0 warnings — exit 0 |
| Typecheck | `npm run typecheck` | 0 errors, 0 warnings, 19 pre-existing hints — exit 0 |

**Baseline failures:** none. The 19 typecheck hints are pre-existing informational notices
(deprecated `document.execCommand`, async-conversion suggestions) — not repaired, out of scope.

## M1 worklist (verified against current code during M0 survey)

1. **Landing gate is not the real evidence gate.** `scripts/pipeline.mjs` `land --gate` runs only
   `npm run verify -- --slug <s> --markdown --network`, never `npm run build`, then calls
   `publishGuide(slug, { gatePassed: true })` — asserting a gate that `evidenceGate()`
   (`scripts/pipeline/publish.mjs`) defines as build **plus** networked verify. Fix: `land --gate`
   must run the real `evidenceGate` (build + networked verify) and base `passed` on it.
2. **Order: compose + integrity run AFTER landing.** `research-pass.yml`: "Land the branch" (step)
   precedes "Run-integrity gate", "Compose check", and "Enforce run integrity". `change.yml`:
   "Land the branch" precedes "Run-integrity gate". A void/burst run or a compose error cannot
   block a merge it should block. Fix: reorder so artifacts, compose and integrity all gate landing
   in both workflows (void remediation still runs; landing is skipped on a failed gate).
3. **Contradiction preflight commits the wrong file.** `applyContradictions()`
   (`scripts/audit/check-intake-contradictions.mjs`) writes `guides-intake/<slug>/ledger.md`;
   `gatePreflight` (`scripts/pipeline/gate.mjs`) stages/commits `guides-intake/<slug>/intake.md`
   only — the written findings are never committed. Fix: commit the ledger file (keep intake in the
   pathspec only if it can legitimately change — it cannot; intake is frozen).

## M1 — done (all three fixes + tests)

1. `landingGate()` added to `scripts/pipeline/publish.mjs`: build → networked markdown verify,
   short-circuit, captured output as scorecard. `pipeline land --gate` now calls it (the bare
   verify-only `execSync` is gone), so `publishGuide(slug, {gatePassed: true})` is an earned claim.
2. `research-pass.yml`: Run-integrity gate (report-only) + void remediation + Compose check
   (now `continue-on-error`) moved BEFORE "Land the branch"; the landing step computes
   `LAND=auto|pr` from `VOID`/`VIOLATIONS`/`COMPOSE_OUTCOME` so any failed gate downgrades the
   landing to a draft PR (human-triage surface preserved, auto-merge blocked). "Enforce run
   integrity" stays last and now also reds the run on `--compose failure` (gateEnforce learned
   `compose`). `change.yml`: Run-integrity gate (`--enforce`, always()) moved BEFORE landing —
   a void change run can no longer open or merge anything.
3. `gatePreflight` commits `preflightCommitPath(slug)` = `guides-intake/<slug>/ledger.md` — the
   file `applyContradictions` actually writes (was intake.md, which is frozen and never written,
   so findings were lost with the runner). new-guide.yml's scaffold path was already correct
   (`landScaffold` adds all of guides-intake/).
- Tests: `scripts/__tests__/pipeline-v2-safety.test.mjs` (13) — landingGate order/short-circuit/
  scorecard/slug-refusal + CLI-seam wiring, preflight write-vs-commit contract (fixture-driven),
  workflow step-order and downgrade-guard text checks for both workflows, enforce wiring.
- Checks: targeted 6 suites (153 ✓) · full `npm test` 156 files / 2413 ✓ · eslint clean on
  changed files.

## Decisions made within engineering discretion

- (M0) Task tracking via harness task list mirrors the milestones; this file remains the durable
  cross-session record.

## Files changed so far

- `docs/pipeline v2/IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md` (new — this file)

## Checks run

- M0 baseline: full suite + build + lint + typecheck (results above).

## Known failures / unverified external boundaries

- None yet. External boundaries not exercised in M0: GitHub Actions dispatch, `gh` CLI paths,
  Cloudflare Worker endpoints, Claude action invocations (all deferred to their milestones; final
  handoff will name what stayed unproven).
